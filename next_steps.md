Congratulations! You have just embarked on a journey into the world of data
analysis in R. Depending on your needs there are several resources to choose
from to further your R skills.  

# Other training courses

If you're interested in taking a longer, more comprehensive course on R, the
CRUK CI Bioinformatics team have taught on these two courses:

[R for Cancer Scientists](https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/r-intro/index.html)

* Developed by the CRUK CI Bioinformatics Core and run for around 100 CRUK CI
scientists during the first COVID-19 lockdown

* In 6 parts run over several weeks with weekly assignments

[Introduction to R for Biologists](https://training.cam.ac.uk/bioinformatics/course/bioinfo-introRbio)

* Run several times a year at the University of Cambridge Bioinformatics Training Facility

* Two day course run either online or in person at the Craik-Marshall building on the Downing site

# Online materials

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)

* Really excellent book that you can purchase, but which is available for free
online, by the principal developer of ggplot2 and the tidyverse

# Graphs and plotting

[R-Graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com)

Want to see more of what you can achieve in ggplot2 and find out how to recreate
many different types of plot? The [R-Graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com)
is the place to go. Choose a plot that interests you to enlarge it and to
display the code that created it. You can use that as a basis for the code for
your plot.

# Specialized area of analysis

[R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com)

This R-bloggers site has a wide collection of articles and tutorials, for
example:

* [Survival analysis in R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/03/steps-to-perform-survival-analysis-in-r)

[RPubs](https://rpubs.com)

Another useful resource is rpubs.com. This is a place where people can publish
R code, for example the following machine learning article:

* [Logistic Regression and KNN: Diabetes Prediction](https://rpubs.com/mirfani28/LBB-cl1)
