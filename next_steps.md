## Next steps   
Congratulations! You have just embarked on major journey  
into the world of data analysis in R!   
Dependent on your needs there are several resources   
to choose from to further yor R skills.  
* Moving onto a mor specialised area of analysis? I recommend the R-bloggers site for a wide collection of articles & tutorials https://www.r-bloggers.com   
Here is an example concerning survival analysis:   
https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/03/steps-to-perform-survival-analysis-in-r/   
* Want to see more of what you can achieve in ggplot 
and find out how to recreate many different types of plot?
The R-Graph gallery is the place to go. It has many graphing 
examples in Base R and ggplot. Choose a plot that interests 
you to enlarge it and to display the code that created 
it. You can use that as a basis for the code for your plot.

* Interested in taking a longer, comprehensive introduction 
to R course?  
Two possibilities we recommend are
  * CRUK-CI Bioinformatics Cores bite-size R course (Materials available at https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/Bite-size-R-v2/)   
  * Introduction to R for Biologists (by Bioinformatics Training, Dept. Genetics) https://training.cam.ac.uk/bioinformatics/course/bioinfo-introRbio   
So which one do I recommend? As someone who ha taught on both sets of materials my answer is a firm "it depends" - people engage with courses differently and what worls for one might not for another. So try the first one you can get on and if it doesn't work for you then try the other. Indeed there will probably be a synergy between them.    

* Another useful resource is rpubs.com. This is a place where people can publish R code. An example is this machine learning article https://rpubs.com/mirfani28/LBB-cl1
