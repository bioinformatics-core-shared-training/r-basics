# Description

**R** is one of the leading programming languages in **Data Science** and the
most widely used within CRUK CI for interacting with cancer biology datasets.

In this training course, we aim to provide a very brief introduction to R aimed
at cancer scientists who would like to be better able to manipulate, visualize
and analyze their data.
